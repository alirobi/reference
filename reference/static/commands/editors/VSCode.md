## Why VSCode?

#### Stack Overflow ranked VS Code the most popular developer environment tool

50.7% of responders said they used VS Code. Visual Studio was number 2 with 31.5% so Microsoft is used by most developers. VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.

#### It supports auto completion for all languages (Javascript, Java, C++, Python, you name it).

It might not sound like a important feature at the beginning. However, it becomes really helpful when you start to have more than just one language in the project.

#### Debug



#### MULTIPLE SELECTIONS

Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+L to split the selection into lines and Ctrl+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection documentation.

#### SPLIT EDITING

Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and using multiple splits in each window.

Take a look at the View ▶ Layout menu for split editing options. To open multiple views into the one file, use the File ▶ New View into File menu item.
