## Why VSCode?

#### Stack Overflow ranked VS Code the most popular developer environment tool

50.7% of responders said they used VS Code. Visual Studio came in second with 31.5% so Microsoft is used by most developers. VSCode helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.

#### It supports auto completion for all languages (Javascript, Java, C++, Python, you name it).

It might not sound like a important feature at the beginning. However, it becomes really helpful when you start to have more than just one language in the project.

#### Debug

Built in interactive debugger for Node.js, JavaScript, Typescript, and debugger extensions for other languages can be downloaded from the VSCode Marketplace.

#### VSCode Marketplace

VSCode extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VSCode.

#### MULTIPLE SELECTIONS

Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

Try highlighting a word and pressing Ctrl+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word.

#### COMMAND PALETTE

The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key bindings.

Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.

#### SPLIT EDITING

Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and using multiple splits in each window.

Take a look at the View â–¶ Editor Layout for split editing options.
